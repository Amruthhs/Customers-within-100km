** 2] Proudest Achievement

What's your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you've worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I'd love to know why you're proud of it, what impact it had (If any) and any insights you took from it.

I believe that my biggest achievement is yet to come, however if I need to take into the consideration of my professional career till date, 
At my last position, I oversaw the implementation of a new software system, which is now used by over 50 employees. I developed a customized training program, worked one-on-one with about one-quarter of the employees and introduced an incentive program to ensure that they stay current with the software. This allowed me to practice planning a large-scale project and motivating a sizable group of employees.
