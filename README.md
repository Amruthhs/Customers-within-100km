## Proudest Achievement
What's your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you've worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I'd love to know why you're proud of it, what impact it had (If any), and any insights you took from it.

ANSWER: I believe that my biggest achievement is yet to come, however, if I need to take into the consideration of my professional career till date, 
In my last position, I implemented a new software system, which is now used by over 50 employees. I developed a customized training program, worked one-on-one with about one-quarter of the employees, and introduced an incentive program to ensure that they stay current with the software. This allowed me to practice planning a large-scale project and motivating a sizable group of employees. The lesson I learnedÂ from the project was "be patient and prepared to problem-solve".
